# About Us

## Who are we?

We are a small team of students enrolled in the Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA) program, currently taking CSE 6242: Data and Visual Analytics.  
Our backgrounds are diverse, but we're united by a shared passion for data science, analytics, and the power of data-driven insights.

## Why this?

This project is part of our coursework for CSE 6242, where we've been tasked with exploring data analysis and visualization techniques on big data.  
For our project, we're leveraging the chess.com API to detect anomalies in player behavior and performance. By using graph modeling, we're able to map player interactions, analyze performance trends, and discover potential irregularities, adding valuable insights into the online chess communities.
